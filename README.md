# Lab 9

## Introduction

The date June 3, 2018 is special because when we write it in the following format, the month times the day equals the year.

06/03/18

Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two-digit year. The program should then determine whether the month times the day is equal to the year.

Below are some sample executions of this program:

```text
Enter a date in the form dd/mm/yy: 06/03/18
Is the date 06/03/18 magic? Yes
```

```text
Enter a date in the form dd/mm/yy: 07/03/18
Is the date 07/03/18 magic? No
```

## Tasks

Clone this repository and create a `develop` branch within which to do your work. After completing each of the following tasks, commit your changes with an appropriate commit message. Before you leave lab, be sure to push your commits to GitHub so you can create a pull request to submit on Blackboard.

1. Update the header comments; removing the TODO comment while you're at it.
1. Stub out your `isMagic` function so that it always returns false.
1. Implement your main function, calling `isMagic` in the appropriate places.
1. Finalize the implementation of your `isMagic` function so that it calculates (and returns) the expected result.

## Submission Details

The usual assignment protocol is followed:

1. Accept this assignment using the URL found in the Blackboard assignment which creates your repository in your GitHub account.
1. Clone your repository and create a branch named develop within which to do your work.
1. Implement the code indicated by the `// TODO:` comments.
1. Minimally make commits after finishing each function; more commits are encouraged but not required.
1. Once the program behaves as prescribed, push your final commit to GitHub and create a pull request, requesting to merge your develop branch into your master branch.
1. After the pull request is created, copy the URL of the pull request and paste it into a Text Submission on Blackboard. You should make the URL a working hyperlink that opens the pull request in a new browser window. NOTE: The assignment is officially submitted by the act of creating and submitting this Blackboard Text Submission and it is the timestamp of that activity that dictates when your assignment was actually submitted.

## Due Date

Your assignment must be submitted to Blackboard by 23:59 Tuesday 03 April 2018.
