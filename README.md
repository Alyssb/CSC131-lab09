The date June l0, 1960 is special because when we write it in the following format, the month times the day equals the year.

6/10/60

Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two-digit year. The program should then determine whether the month times the day is equal to the year.

Below are some sample executions of this program:

```text
Enter a date in the form dd/mm/yy: 06/03/18
Is the date 06/03/18 magic? Yes
```

```text
Enter a date in the form dd/mm/yy: 07/03/18
Is the date 07/03/18 magic? No
```
